= Migrating applications to {VertX} HTTP client

The HTTP client has fine grained control over HTTP interactions and focuses on the HTTP protocol.

The HTTP client has been updated and improved in {VertX} {v4}:

* Simplified APIs with fewer interactions
* Robust error handling
* Support for connection reset for HTTP/1

The updates in HTTP client APIs are:

* The methods in `HttpClientRequest` such as, `get()`, `delete()`, `put()` have been removed. Use the method `HttpClientRequest>	request(HttpMethod method, â€¦)` instead.

* `HttpClientRequest` instance is created when a request or response is possible. For example, an `HttpClientRequest` instance is created when the client connects to the server or a connection is reused from the pool.

== Sending a simple request

The following example shows how to send a GET request in {VertX} {v3x} releases.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
HttpClientRequest request = client.get(80, "example.com", "/", response -> {
  int statusCode = response.statusCode();
  response.exceptionHandler(err -> {
    // Handle connection error, for example, connection closed
  });
  response.bodyHandler(body -> {
    // Handle body entirely
  });
});
request.exceptionHandler(err -> {
  // Handle connection error OR response error
});
request.end();
----

The following example shows how to send a GET request in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
client.request(HttpMethod.GET, 80, "example.com", "/", ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    HttpClientRequest = ar.result();
    request.send(ar2 -> {
      if (ar2.succeeded()) {
        HttpClientResponse = ar2.result();
        int statusCode = response.statusCode();
        response.body(ar3 -> {
          if (ar3.succeeded()) {
            Buffer body = ar3.result();
            // Handle body entirely
          } else {
            // Handle server error, for example, connection closed
          }
        });
      } else {
        // Handle server error, for example, connection closed
      }
    });
  } else {
    // Connection error, for example, invalid server or invalid SSL certificate
  }
});
----

You can see that error handling is better in the new HTTP client.

The following example shows how to use future composition in a GET operation in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
Future<Buffer> fut = client.request(HttpMethod.GET, 80, "example.com", "/")
  .compose(request -> request.send().compose(response -> {
    int statusCode = response.statusCode();
    if (statusCode == 200) {
      return response.body();
    } else {
      return Future.failedFuture("Unexpectd status code");
    }
  })
});
fut.onComplete(ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    Buffer body = ar.result();
    // Handle body entirely
  } else {
    // Handle error
  }
});
----

Future composition improves exception handling. The example checks if the status code is 200, otherwise it returns an error.

WARNING: When you use the HTTP client with futures, the `HttpClientResponse()` method starts emitting buffers as soon as it receives a response. To avoid this, ensure that the future composition occurs either on the event-loop (as shown in the example) or it should pause and resume the response.

== Sending requests

In {VertX} {v3x} releases, you could use the `end()` method to send requests.

[source,java]
----
request.end();
----

You could also send a body in the request.

[source,java]
----
request.end(Buffer.buffer("hello world));
----

Since `HttpClientRequest` is a `Writestream<Buffer>`, you could also use a pipe to stream the request.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
writeStream.pipeTo(request, ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    // Sent the stream
  }
});
----

In {VertX} {v4}, you can perform all the operations shown in the examples using the `get()` method. You can also use the new `send()` method to perform these operations. You can pass a buffer, a string, or a `ReadStream` as input to the `send()` method. The method returns an `HttpClientResponse` instance.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
// Send a request and process the response
request.onComplete(ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    HttpClientResponse response = ar.result();
    // Handle the response
  }
})
request.end();

// The new send method combines all the operations
request.send(ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    HttpClientResponse response = ar.result();
    // Handle the response
  }
}));
----

== Handling responses

The `HttpClientResponse` interface has been updated and improved with the following methods:

`body()` method::
The `body()` method returns an asynchronous buffer. Use the `body()` method instead of `bodyHandler()`.
+
The following example shows how to use the `bodyHandler()` method to get the request body.
+
[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
response.bodyHandler(body -> {
  // Process the request body
});
response.exceptionHandler(err -> {
  // Could not get the request body
});
----
+
The following example shows how to use the `body()` method to get the request body.
+
[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
response.body(ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    // Process the request body
  } else {
    // Could not get the request body
  }
});
----

`end()` method:: The `end()` method returns a future when a response is fully received successfully or failed. The method removes the response body. Use this method instead of `endHandler()` method.
+
The following example shows how to use the `endHandler()` method.
+
[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
response.endHandler(v -> {
  // Response ended
});
response.exceptionHandler(err -> {
  // Response failed, something went wrong
});
----
+
The following example shows how to use the `end()` method.
+
[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
response.end(ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    // Response ended
  } else {
    // Response failed, something went wrong
  }
});
----

You can also handle the response with methods such as, `onSucces()`, `compose()`, `bodyHandler()` and so on. The following examples demonstrate handling responses using the `onSuccess()` method.

The following example shows how to use HTTP client with the `result()` method in {VertX} {v3x} releases.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
HttpClient client = vertx.createHttpClient(options);

    client.request(HttpMethod.GET, 8443, "localhost", "/")
      .onSuccess(request -> {
        request.onSuccess(resp -> {

        //Code to handle HTTP response
        });
      });
----

The following example shows how to use HTTP client with the `result()` method in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
HttpClient client = vertx.createHttpClient(options);

    client.request(HttpMethod.GET, 8443, "localhost", "/")
      .onSuccess(request -> {
        request.response().onSuccess(resp -> {

        //Code to handle HTTP response
        });
      });
----
