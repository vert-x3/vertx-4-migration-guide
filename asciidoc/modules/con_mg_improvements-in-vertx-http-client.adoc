= Improvements in the {VertX} HTTP client

This section describes the improvements in HTTP client.

== HTTP client request and response methods take an asynchronous handler as input argument

The `HttpClient` and `HttpClientRequest` methods have been updated to use asynchronous handlers. The methods take `Handler<AsyncResult<HttpClientResponse>>` as input instead of `Handler<HttpClientResponse>`.

In earlier releases of {VertX}, the `HttpClient` methods `getNow()`, `optionsNow()` and `headNow()` used to return `HttpClientRequest`, that you had to further send to perform a request. The `getNow()`, `optionsNow()` and `headNow()` methods have been removed. In {VertX} {v4}, you can directly send a request with the required information using `Handler<AsyncResult<HttpClientResponse>>`.

The following examples show how to send a request in {VertX} {v3x}.

* To perform a GET operation:
+
[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
Future<HttpClientResponse> f1 = client.get(8080, "localhost", "/uri", HttpHeaders.set("foo", "bar"));
----

* To POST with a buffer body:
+
[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
Future<HttpClientResponse> f2 = client.post(8080, "localhost", "/uri", HttpHeaders.set("foo", "bar"), Buffer.buffer("some-data"));
----

* To POST with a streaming body:
+
[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
Future<HttpClientResponse> f3 = client.post(8080, "localhost", "/uri", HttpHeaders.set("foo", "bar"), asyncFile);
----

In {VertX} {v4}, you can use the `requests` methods to create an `HttpClientRequest` instance. These methods can be used in basic interactions such as:

* Sending the request headers
* HTTP/2 specific operations such as setting a push handler, setting stream priority, pings, and so on.
* Creating a NetSocket tunnel
* Providing fine grained write control
* Resetting a stream
* Handling 100 continue headers manually

The following example shows you how to create an `HTTPClientRequest` in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
client.request(HttpMethod.GET, 8080, "example.com", "/resource", ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    HttpClientRequest request = ar.result();
    request.putHeader("content-type", "application/json")
    request.send(new JsonObject().put("hello", "world"))
      .onSuccess(response -> {
      //
      }).onFailure(err -> {
      //
       });
     }
})
----

== Removed the connection handler method from HTTP client request

The `HttpClientRequest.connectionHandler()` method has been removed. Use `HttpClient.connectionHandler()` method instead to call connection handlers for client requests in your application.

The following example shows how the `HttpClientRequest.connectionHandler()` method was used in {VertX} {v3x} releases.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
client.request().connectionHandler(conn -> {
  // Connection related code
}).end();
----

The following example shows you how to use the new `HttpClient.connectionHandler()` method.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
client.connectionHandler(conn -> {
// Connection related code
});
----

== HTTP client tunneling using the net socket method

HTTP tunnels can be created using the `HttpClientResponse.netSocket()` method. In {VertX} {v4} this method has been updated.

To get a net socket for the connection of the request, send a socket handler in the request. The handler is called when the HTTP response header is received. The socket is ready for tunneling and can send and receive buffers.

The following example shows how to get net socket for a connection in {VertX} {v3x} releases.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
client.request(HttpMethod.CONNECT, uri, ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    HttpClientResponse response = ar.result();
    if (response.statusCode() == 200) {
      NetSocket so = response.netSocket();
   }
  }
}).end();
----

The following example shows how to get net socket for a connection in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
client.request(HttpMethod.CONNECT, uri, ar -> {
}).netSocket(ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
   // Got a response with a 200 status code
   NetSocket so = ar.result();
   // Go for tunneling
  }
}).end();
----

== New `send()` method in `HttpClient` class

A new `send()` method is available in the `HttpClient` class.

The following code shows how to send a request in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java]
----
Future<HttpClientResponse> f1 = client.send(HttpMethod.GET, 8080, "localhost", "/uri", HttpHeaders.set("foo", "bar"));
----

== HttpHeaders is an interface and contains `MultiMap` methods

In {VertX} {v4}, `HttpHeaders` is an interface. In earlier releases of {VertX},  `HttpHeaders` was a class.

The following new `MultiMap` methods have been added in the `HttpHeaders` interface. Use these methods to create `MultiMap` instances.

* `MultiMap.headers()`
* `MultiMap.set(CharSequence name, CharSequence value)`
* `MultiMap.set(String name, String value)`

The following example shows how `MultiMap` instances were created in {VertX} {v3x} releases.

[source,java]
----
MultiMap headers = MultiMap.caseInsensitiveMultiMap();
----

The following examples show how to create `MultiMap` instances in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java]
----
MultiMap headers = HttpHeaders.headers();
----

[source,java]
----
MultiMap headers = HttpHeaders.set("content-type", "application.data");
----

== `CaseInsensitiveHeaders` class is no longer public

The `CaseInsensitiveHeaders` class is no longer public. Use the `MultiMap.caseInsensitiveMultiMap()` method to create a multi-map implementation with case insensitive keys.

The following example shows how `CaseInsensitiveHeaders` method was used in {VertX} {v3x} releases.

[source,java]
----
CaseInsensitiveHeaders headers = new CaseInsensitiveHeaders();
----

The following examples show how `MultiMap` method is used in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java]
----
MultiMap multiMap = MultiMap#caseInsensitiveMultiMap();
----

OR

[source,java]
----
MultiMap headers = HttpHeaders.headers();
----

== Checking the version of HTTP running on the server

In earlier releases of {VertX}, the version of HTTP running on a server was checked only if the application explicitly called the `HttpServerRequest.version()` method. If the HTTP version was HTTP/1.x, the method would return the 501 HTTP status, and close the connection.

From {VertX} {v4} onward, before a request is sent to the server, the HTTP version on the server is automatically checked by calling the `HttpServerRequest.version()` method. The method returns the HTTP version instead of throwing an exception when an invalid HTTP version is found.

== New methods in request options

In {VertX} {v4}, the following new methods are available in the `RequestOptions` class:

* Header
* FollowRedirects
* Timeout

The following example shows how to use the new methods.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
client.request(HttpMethod.GET, 8080, "example.com", "/resource", ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    HttpClientRequest request = ar.result();
    request.putHeader("content-type", "application/json")
    request.send(new JsonObject().put("hello", "world"))
      .onSuccess(response -> {
      //
      }).onFailure(err -> {
      //
       });
     }
})
----
