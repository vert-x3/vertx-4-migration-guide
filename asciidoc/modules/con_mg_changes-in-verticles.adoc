= Changes in verticles

This section explains the changes in the verticles.

== Updates in the create verticle method

In earlier releases of {VertX}, `VerticleFactory.createVerticle()` method synchronously instantiated a verticle. From {VertX} {v4} onward, the method asynchronously instantiates the verticle and returns the callback `Callable<Verticle>` instead of the single verticle instance. This improvement enables the application to call this method once and invoke the returned callable multiple times for creating multiple instances.

The following code shows how verticles were instantiated in {VertX} {v3x} releases.

[source,java]
----
Verticle createVerticle(String verticleName, ClassLoader classLoader) throws Exception;
----

The following code shows how verticles are instantiated in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java]
----
void createVerticle(String verticleName, ClassLoader classLoader, Promise<Callable<Verticle>> promise);
----

== Updates in the factory class and methods

The `VerticleFactory` class has been simplified. The class does not require initial resolution of an identifier because the factory can instead use nested deployment to deploy the verticle.

If your existing applications use factories, in {VertX} {v4} you can update the code to use a callable when a promise completes or fails. The callable can be called several times.

The following example shows existing factories in an {VertX} {v3x} application.

[source,java]
----
return new MyVerticle();
----

The following example shows how to update existing factories to use promise in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java]
----
promise.complete(() -> new MyVerticle());
----

Use the `Vertx.executeBlocking()` method, if you want the factory to block code. When the factory receives the blocking code, it should resolve the promise and get the verticle instances from the promise.

== Removed the multithreaded worker verticles

Multi-threaded worker verticle deployment option has been removed. This feature could only be used with {VertX} event-bus. Other {VertX} components such as HTTP did not support the feature.

Use the unordered `Vertx.executeBlocking()` method to achieve the same functionality as multi-threaded worker deployment.
