= Changes in connection methods

This section explains the changes in connection methods.

== Checking if authentication is required for client

The `NetServerOptions.isClientAuthRequired()` method has been removed. Use the `getClientAuth() == ClientAuth.REQUIRED` enumerated type to check if client authentication is required.

The following example shows how to use a switch statement to check if authentication of the client is required.

[source,java]
----
switch (options.getClientAuth()) {
case REQUIRED:
// ... behavior same as in releases prior to {VertX} {v4}
break;
default:
// fallback statement...
}
----

The following example shows how to use the check if authentication of the client is required in {Vertx} {v4}.

[source,java]
----
if (options.getClientAuth() == ClientAuth.REQUIRED) {
// behavior in releases prior to {VertX} {v4}
----

== Upgrade SSL method uses asynchronous handler

The `NetSocket.upgradeToSsl()` method has been updated to use `Handler<AsyncResult>` instead of `Handler`. The handler is used to check if the channel has been successfully upgraded to SSL or TLS.
