= Changes in {VertX} Reactive Extensions (Rx)

This section describes the changes in Reactive Extensions (Rx) in {VertX}. {VertX} uses the RxJava library.

== Support for RxJava 3

From {VertX} 4.1.0, RxJava 3 is supported.

* A new rxified API is available in the `io.vertx.rxjava3` package.

* Integration with {VertX} JUnit5 is provided by the `vertx-junit5-rx-java3` binding.

To upgrade to RxJava 3, you must make the following changes:

* In the `pom.xml` file, under `<dependency>` change the RxJava 1 and 2 bindings from `vertx-rx-java` or `vertx-rx-java2` to `vertx-rx-java3`.

* In your application, update the imports from `io.vertx.reactivex.\*` to `io.vertx.rxjava3.*`.

* In your application, update the imports for RxJava 3 types also. For more information, see _Whatâ€™s new_ section in RxJava 3 documentation.

== Removed `onComplete` callback from write stream

The `WriteStreamSubscriber.onComplete()` callback has been removed. This callback was invoked if `WriteStream` had pending streams of data to be written.

In {VertX} {v4}, use the callbacks `WriteStreamSubscriber.onWriteStreamEnd()` and `WriteStreamSubscriber.onWriteStreamError()` instead. These callbacks are called after `WriteStream.end()` is complete.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
WriteStreamSubscriber<Buffer> subscriber = writeStream.toSubscriber();
----

The following example shows how to create the adapter from a `WriteStream` in {VertX} {v3x} releases.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
subscriber.onComplete(() -> {
    // Called after writeStream.end() is invoked, even if operation has not completed
});
----

The following examples show how to create the adapter from a WriteStream using the new callback methods in {VertX} {v4} release:

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
subscriber.onWriteStreamEnd(() -> {
    // Called after writeStream.end() is invoked and completes successfully
});
----

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
subscriber.onWriteStreamError(() -> {
    // Called after writeStream.end() is invoked and fails
});
----
