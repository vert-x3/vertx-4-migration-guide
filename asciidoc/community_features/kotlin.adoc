= Kotlin changes

== Generated coroutine extension methods

Vert.x 3 generates extension suspending extension methods, e.g `get(Handler<AsyncResult<Result>>`
generates `getAwait()` extension method.

```kotlin
// getSomethingAwait() is a generated extension method
// and is deprecated
var result = getSomethingAwait();
```

Vert.x 4 provides a future based model and the Vert.x `Future` has an `await()` extension methods
that does the same. The code above can simply be rewritten as

```kotlin
var result = getSomething().await();
```

== Script compiler

Vert.x 3 provides a Kotlin Script compiler based on Kotlin Compiler API.

The API often breaks and creates friction for upgrading Kotlin versions.

This is removed in Vert.x 4.0.

Such scripts should now be handled by Kotlin tools, e.g the Kotlin compiler has options
to compile these scripts.
