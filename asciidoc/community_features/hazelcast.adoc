= Changes in Hazelcast cluster manager

The following section describes the changes in the Hazelcast cluster manager.

== Updates in custom configurations

The Hazelcast cluster manager is based on Hazelcast 4.

In {VertX} {v4}, the clustering SPI has been redesigned. The subscription data model has changed. As a result of this, {VertX} {v3x} nodes and {VertX} {v4} nodes cannot be added together in the same Hazelcast cluster.

The {VertX} applications are not impacted by this change as the EventBus and SharedData APIs remain the same.

If you had a custom Hazelcast configuration file in your {VertX} {v3x} application:

* Add the map `__vertx.nodeInfo`.
